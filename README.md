# Mini Project: Sudoku Solver Design and Analysis

This project involves the design, analysis, and implementation of a Sudoku solver. The solver's objective is to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels while minimizing computation time, memory consumption, and early detection of failing paths.

**Objectives:**

- Formulate the Sudoku problem, specifying the variables, their domains, and constraints with their types (unary, binary, higher-order, global).

- Analyze the backtracking algorithm with alternative approaches that aim to reduce computation time, memory consumption, or promote early detection of failing paths.

- Implement the approach deemed most effective or efficient based on the conducted analysis.

- Test and analyze the implemented algorithm for at least three different levels of Sudoku difficulty.

**Methodology:**

- Begin by understanding and defining the structure of the Sudoku problem, identifying the variables, their potential values (domains), and the constraints that guide the solution.

- Thoroughly analyze the backtracking algorithm, traditionally used to solve Sudoku puzzles, considering alternative techniques or improvements that could enhance its performance in terms of speed, memory usage, and early failure detection.

- Choose and implement the most promising approach based on the analytical findings, ensuring the design is clean, efficient, and robust.

- Validate the functionality and efficiency of the developed Sudoku solver by testing it against Sudoku puzzles of at least three different difficulty levels. Document the performance of the solver in each scenario.

**Expected Outcomes:**

The expected outcome is a robust and efficient Sudoku solver capable of solving puzzles of varying difficulty levels. The project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the problem-solving techniques used in constraint satisfaction problems, especially focusing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the backtracking algorithm. The final product should illustrate the practical application of these techniques in creating an efficient Sudoku solver.
